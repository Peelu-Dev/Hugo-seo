## Introduction

### When we are in pain, the usual courses of action involve  medical treatment or painkillers. However, we can also help to  control pain ourselves by regulating our mental response-both to the pain and to the stress it causes.

- Pain is an emotional as well as a physical response to injury or disease. Intense fear or anxiety are vital immediate reactions that cause you to avoid sources of pain whenever possible.

- Sometimes, however, pain persists even when the injury or disease is no longer present. A painful sensation can become associated with constant stress, recurring unpleasant memories of what caused the pain, or the constant fear that it will persist or recur.

- These feelings can be powerful and unsettling. Although you should always seek medical advice if pain is severe or prolonged, you can also use several techniques to regulate it by training your mind.

## The Pain-Killer Problem

- Medication is often essential to control pain in the short term, but taking Pain-Killers for an extended period can lead to issues such as addiction, or serious side-effects, including stomach ulcers and diseases.

- Our body may also build up to a tolerance to a drug, so that we derive less benefits from it as time goes on for a longer period of time.

## Mind-Body Therapies

- In addition to medication, we can use mind-body techniques such as relaxation and visualization to reduce or help control pain-with no risk of side effects.

- Most use relaxation and deep, controlled breathing exercises to reduce the tension that comes with pain and often make it worse. Try lying quietly in a darkened room; breathe in deeply while counting to 10, hold the breathe for a moment, then exhale slowly for a count of 10. Continue this for 10-20 minutes.

- Shifting your attention often reduces pain's severity. Try turning your attention away from the painful area, focusing on a non-painful part of your body. Alternatively, imagine the pain as a big ball of energy outside your body, and "shrink" it in your mind.

- Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) uses a similar approach, by training you to replace negative thoughts like "this pain is unbearable", or "I can't stop this pain" with positive ones such as "the pain is temporary".

- Practicing mindfulness reduces stress, making you better able to cope with pain. In this practice, adapted from Buddhist teachings, you merely acknowledge the pain- of allowing it to dominate your thoughts or exhausting yourself by actively fighting it.

## To sum up, your brain can be a powerful tool for controlling your pain if you:-

- Practice relaxation and deep breathing techniques to reduce stress levels.

- Do mental exercises to shift attention away from your pain.

- Use CBT techniques to focus on positive thoughts.

- Practice Mindfulness.
