## Introduction

## To survive in our environment we must be able to react to, and interact with, stimuli produced by physical, chemical, and biological phenomena- sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and  touches. Sensors in the body pick up these signals and send them to the brain for decode.

## Senses

- Each sense has its own set of detectors. Most are localised in a specific area of the body, except for touch, which is spread all over the skin, as well inside the body.

- Although the neurons and receptors for each sense are largely dedicated to that sense alone, they can sometimes overlap. Sensory information continuosly bombards the Brain, but only a fraction of input reaches consciousness.

- Even so, the "unnoticed" information can still guide our actions, proprioception, which relays information  about the body's position in space.

## Different types of senses

- ### Touch :- Thought to be the first sense to develop in the womb, touch neurons respond to pressure, temperature, vibration, pain and light touch. Touch is how humans make  physical contact with the environment and with each other.

- ### Hearing :- Sound waves in the  air are  collected by the ear and transmitted into the skull, where they are turned into electrical impulses by the  cochlea. Hearing is the most developed of the senses at birth but is only complete by the end of the first year.

- ### Sight :- It involves sensors at the back of the eyes that turn  light into electrical signals. These are transported to the back of the brain, where they are converted into colours, fine details, and motion. We perceive objects as little as half a second.

- ### Smell :- Despite having only 400 smell receptors. Humans can detect upto a  trillion different fragrants. Smell is important for survival as it warns us of hazardous substances around us or events, such as something burning, it also plays a key role in taste.

- ### Taste :- It is important in determining what is safe and nutritious to eat. Taste receptors pick up only five basic tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami(savoury). We need our sense to help identify a taste.

- ### Proprioception :- The Brain is constantly processing information from the joints and  muscles that tell it where the body is in space. It keeps us upright and allows us to make movements without conscious efforts, such as walking up stairs.

### How many senses are there?

### Including the six senses described here, Scientists think there may be  as many as 20 senses. based on the number of different receptor types in the body
