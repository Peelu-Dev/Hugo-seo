## The brain is the body's control center. It coordinates the basic functions required for survival, controls body movements, and processes sensory data. However, it also encodes a lifetime of memories and creates consciousness, imagination and our sense of self.

### Memory :- The Brain remembers a bank of semantic knowledge, general facts bout the world, as well as a personal record of life history. The function of memory is to aid future survival by encoding useful information from the past and make ourselves feel good and sometimes worst as well based on the past experiences.

### Movement :- To contract, muscles rely on the same kind of electrical impulses that carry nervous signals through the brain and body. All muscle movement is caused by nerve signal, but the conscious brain has a limited control over it and makes us move.

### Control :- The basic body systems, such as breathing, circulation, digestion, and excretion, are all under the ultimate control of the brain, which seeks to modify their rates to suit the needs of the body and makes us healthy.

### Thinking :- The brain is where thought and imagination takes place and makes us intelligent as compared to animals. Thinking is a cognitive activity that allows us to interpret the world around us, while our imagination helps us to consider possibilities in the mind without input from the senses to build some amazing products according to our needs and wants.

### Sensory experience :- Imagination arriving from all over the body is processed in the brain to create a highly rich detailed picture of our body's surroundings. The brain filters out a great deal of sensory data deemed irrelevant and makes our mind more clearer.

### Communication :- A unique feature of the Human Brain is the speech center that control the formulation of language and the muscular execution of speech. The Brain is also uses a predictive system to listen and understand what someone else is saying and respond according to it.

### Emotions :- Most theories of emotion suggest that they are destined modes of behavior that boost our survival chances when we encounter confusing or dangerous situations. While others emotions are animal instincts leaking through into human consciousness.
