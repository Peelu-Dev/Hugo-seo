## Introduction

- Just as exercise builds muscles and improves cardiovascular fitness, there are activities that can improve your creativity conditioning, by getting areas of the brain to work together in new ways.

- To boost creativity, you must first remove barriers to it. Stress, time limitation, and lack of sleep or exercise are known as creativity-killers.
- People tend to be creative when they are are rested, happy, and can let their thoughts wander freely. Many people claims to have their best ideas during their morning shower or walk to work.
- It seems that ideas flow most freely around our brains when they are not in a task-oriented state but instead in a condition called the resting state.

## Cultivating new connections

- Routines help regualte our daily lives, but they also reinforce existing neural pathways. Creativity-friendly activities create new neural connections.Learning to play a musical instrument, for example, opens and strengthens links between different brain areas.

- Simply varying your routine can also foster creativity, so pick a more interesting route to work, a colour you don't usually wear, or a new recipe to cook.Surround yourself with like-minded, creative people as much as possible.Wheather it is in a gallery or a garden shed, new inputs stimulates new  ideas.

- Allow yourself to disconnect.If you are stuck in a queue, don't default your phone to check emails or social media; instead, zone out and let the ideas flow.

## The next time you are stuck for ideas, try one of the following given below:-

- ### Get enough rest, de-stress and exercise.

- ### Learn a new skill. Spend time with other creative people.

- ### Think outside the box. Think of new ways to solve old problems.

- ### Switch off from digital devices to give your brain some down-time.
