## Introduction

## Although a few children exhibit remarkable skills, most people with exceptional memory are not born that way. Instead, they use special techniques and lots of practice, sometimes leading to physical changes in their brains.

## Training Exceptional memories

- Scientists studying trainee London taxi drivers as they learnt "the knowledge" (a huge network of roads and landmarks) found that the volume of the subjects posterior hippocampi increased as their ability to navigate improved.

- This could occur due to the birth of new neurons or the growth of existing dendries. However, the taxi drivers performed worse than control subjects in memory tests not involving london landmarks. This suggests memory is finite, and improving one area may come at experience of others.

## FlashBulb Memories

- People often remember where they were receiving emotional news, and the memory seems extremely vivid and detailed. These are called FlashBulb memories. However, studies have shown that we are as likely to be mistaken about these snapshots as we are about any other memories.

## PhotoGraphic Memory

- There is no such thing as PhotoGraphic memory-no-one can literally recall pages of text or images as if they were really in front of them.

- The closest is eidetic memory, which occurs in 2-10 percent of children. After looking an image, "eidetikers" continue to "see" it in their visual field, until it gradually fades or disappears as they blink.

## Picture imperfect

- Studies have shown that eidetic images are not perfect. Children may not manage to remember all letters in a word they were shown, or may invent details, for example "recalling" something in a picture that was not really there.

## Can people remember everything?

- A perfect memory doesn't exist, but a few people have superior autobiographical memory, giving them exceptional recall for events during their lives.
