### Identifying a smell out of of the many aroma in the world around us involves the olfactory system, which isolates different chemicals and then passes signals on to the brain to determine whether they are "good" or "bad".

## What makes a smell?

#### How we identify smells is still a matter of debate for many years. Research suggests that most fragrance fall into ten groups-or primary fragrance-each of which alerts us to something in the environment. Most smells are made up of a combination of these groups. Smell is a key part of survival, telling us whether something is safe or dangerous and gives important information to the Brain.

### Fragrant :- Light, natural scents such as flowers, grasses, and herbs, typically used in perfumes gives an attracting smell and makes most of our brain's relaxing and cheerful.

### Minty :- Cool, fresh, and revitalize, digested by mint, eucalyptus and camphor.
