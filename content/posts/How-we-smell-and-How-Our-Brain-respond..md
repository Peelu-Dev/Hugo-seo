### Identifying a smell out of of the many aroma in the world around us involves the olfactory system, which isolates different chemicals and then passes signals on to the brain to determine whether they are "good" or "bad".

## What makes a smell?

#### How we identify smells is still a matter of debate for many years. Research suggests that most fragrance fall into ten groups-or primary fragrance-each of which alerts us to something in the environment. Most smells are made up of a combination of these groups. Smell is a key part of survival, telling us whether something is safe or dangerous and gives important information to the Brain.

### Fruity :- Typically includes warm, ripe fruits and other fresh scents that have a sense of smoothness on the nose and makes our digestive system more healthy.

### Citrus :- Separate from other fruits, citrus has fresh, clean, acidic, aaromas with a touch of sweetness so that our body will release harmful toxins easily.f

### Woody and resinous :- Earthy, natural smells such as compost, fungi, spices, cedar, pine, and mold have its own kind of smells.

### Chemical :- It includes synthetic, medicinal, solvent, and gasoline fragrance that are easily identifiable.

### Sweet :- Warm, rich, sugary smells with a touch of creaminess, including chocolate, malt, and vanilla makes us to eat more and more most of the time.

### Minty :- Cool, fresh, and revitalize, digested by mint, eucalyptus and camphor.

### Toasted and nutty :- Slightly burned and caramelized with warm and fatty overtones, such as popcorn and peanut butter.

### Pungent :- Often unpleasant smells such as manure or sour milk, onions, garlic, and pickles have its pungent kind of smell.

### Decayed :- Beyond pungent are the fragrance of rotting food, sewage, household gas, and other "sickening" substances.

## Why do Smells Trigger Memories?

### Unlike our other senses, smells bypass the thalamus and go straight to the limbic system. Emotions and memories are processed and stored here, especially in the amygdala which is responsible for fight or flight mode.
